# Iris Classification Project

This repository contains an implementation of multiple machine learning classification algorithms on the Iris dataset, along with an interactive Streamlit web app for real-time prediction.

## 🔍 Project Motivation

The goal of this project is to explore and compare basic classification algorithms on a classic dataset and to build an interactive interface to make real-time predictions using the trained models.

## 📊 Dataset

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. It consists of 150 samples with four features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Each sample is classified into one of three species:

- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## ⚙️ Models Used

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**
3. **Random Forest Classifier**

## 📈 Model Performance

| Model               | Accuracy  |
|--------------------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression| ~97%      |
| Decision Tree      | ~100%     |
| Random Forest      | ~100%     |

> Note: Performance may vary slightly based on the train-test split.

## 🖥️ Streamlit App

An interactive Streamlit app is included. You can choose the model and input feature values to see real-time predictions.

### Screenshots

(Include screenshots of the Streamlit app here, if possible)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Script Version

```bash
python iris_classifier.py
```

### Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```


## 🧪 Future Enhancements

- Add unit tests
- Add visualizations for better data exploration
- Improve user interface of the Streamlit app
- Add support for saving and loading models
